	<h3>Convergent</h3>
		
	<ul>
		<h4>Oceanic/Oceanic</h4>
			<p>A boundary where one of the plates is being pushed below the other causing a subduction zone. The colder and denser plate will be pushed below the warmer and younger plate.
</p>

<h4>Continental/Continental</h4>
			<p>A boundary where two plates collide with each other. Due to both the plates being cold and dense they cannot create subduction zones. When they collide they smash into each other.

<h4>Continental/Oceanic</h4>
			<p>A tectonic plate that is composed of oceanic lithosphere collides with a plate composed of continental lithosphere. There is a subduction zone formed here. </p>

	<h3>Divergent</h3>
		
		<ul>
			
			<h4>Continental</h4>
				<p>Where two continental plates move away from each other creating a rift-shaped structure. As they break away from each other they arch upwards from the convection currents below.
</p>

<h4>Oceanic</h4>
				<p>Where two oceanic plates move away from each other creating a mid-ocean ridge. The rising convection currents lift the plates, as they move farther away, magma seeps through the cracks and solidifies.</p>
			
<h4>Transform</h4>
				<p>Transform boundaries when two plates slide past each other. Due to them only sliding across each other they can not create or destroy. Transform boundaries create fault lines.
