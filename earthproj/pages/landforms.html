	<h3>Deep Ocean Trenches</h3>
		<p>A deep ocean trench occurs when one plate subducts under another.</p>

<h3>Mid-Ocean Ridge</h3>
		<p>The Mid-Ocean Ridge is an extensive chain of mountains that spreads over 40,000 miles and is 90% of the mountain range that lays in deeply in the ocean. They are created when two tectonic plates spread apart.</p>

<h3>Volcano</h3>
		<p>A Volcano is a mountain or hill that contains magma. They are often classified as active, dormant, or extinct. When a volcano is active it means it has erupted in the near past and will erupt in the near future. When a volcano is dormant it means it has erupted in the far past and has an unknown probability of when it will erupt again, but will one day in the future. Lastly, when a volcano is extinct it means it hasn’t erupted in a very long time and is not expected to erupt in the future. They are created by subduction zones, found in the Ring of Fire.

<h3>Mountains</h3>
		<p>Mountains are elevated portions of the Earth's crust. They are created when two tectonic plates collide. </p>

<h3>Rift Valley</h3>
		<p>A rift valley is a crack in the Earth’s crust. They are created when tectonic plates break apart.</p>
