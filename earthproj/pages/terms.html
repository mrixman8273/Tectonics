	<h4>Subduction</h4>
		<p>When one plate goes below another plate into the Earth’s mantle.</p>
	<h4>Magma</h4>
		<p>A semiliquid material below the Earth’s crust, makes up the Earth’s mantle.</p>
	<h4>Seafloor Spreading</h4>
		<p>When two tectonic plates split apart due to the convection currents in the Earth’s mantle.
</p>
	<h4>Convection</h4>
		<p>When the hottest parts of the mantle rise from deep in the mantle. While that is occurring, the cooler parts of the mantle are being sunk. Which is the process of convection currents.
</p>
	<h4>New Crust Being Formed</h4>
		<p>New crust being formed is an effect of seafloor spreading.</p>
	<h4>Earthquake Prone Area</h4>
		<p>An earthquake-prone area is primarily transformation boundaries. As they slide past one another they sometimes create such pressure that it continues to build up and that energy creates seismic waves.</p>
